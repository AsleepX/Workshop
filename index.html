                    We study a set function via its market extension: each player in the set possesses certain endowments and the worth of a subset is determined by the corresponding total endowments, as well as a common (continuous) production function. Compared with usual extensions where each production function corresponds to a single set function, each production in the market extension corresponds to an infinite number of set functions. We prove that the associated set functions are supermodular if and only if the production function is ultramodular. We study Walrasian cores of ultramodular production functions and prove several desirable properties resembling well-known ones of supermodular set functions.

            <div id="day7" class="details-content">
                This paper analyzes a network game in a local-average setup where a player's payoff depends on the social norm he confronts. I focus on an optimal targeting intervention problem where a planner seeks to maximize his objective via changing the individual attributes and/or restructure the underlying network subject to certain constraints. First, I discuss the absolute characteristic intervention problem under a quadratic budget constraint. I give the limit forms of the optimal intervention under, respectively, extremely large and extremely small budgets. Then, I proceed to identify the errors stemming from approximating the optimal intervention with its limit forms. Next, I study the relative intervention problem in which a planner maximizes the ratio of the equilibrium social welfare over its first-best counterpart subject to a quadratic budget constraint. In what follows, I turn to the structural intervention problem, where a social planner designs endogenously a network to maximize the social welfare subject to the unanimous consent constraints of players. It is shown that whether or not a positive result is achievable relies on the degree of individual conformism, and their tolerance regarding minor loss.

            <div id="day9" class="details-content">
                Motivated by practical constraints in online advertising, we investigate single-parameter auction design for bidders with constraints on their Return On Investment (ROI) – a targeted minimum ratio between the obtained value and the payment. We focus on ex post ROI constraints, which require the ROI condition to be satisfied for every realized value profile. With ROI-constrained bidders, we provide a full characterization of the allocation and payment rules of dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) auctions. In particular, we show that given any monotone allocation rule, the corresponding DSIC payment should be the Myerson payment with a rebate for each bidder to meet their ROI constraints. Furthermore, we also determine the optimal auction structure when the item is sold to a single bidder under a mild regularity condition. This structure entails a randomized allocation scheme and a first-price payment rule, which differs from the deterministic Myerson auction and previous works on ex ante ROI constraints.

                Understanding human strategic behavior is crucial for designing effective market mechanisms. Conventional economic models often rely on assumptions of human rationality and perfect knowledge, which sometimes make it difficult to accurately characterize human behavior in complex real-world markets. In this talk, we will introduce two deep learning-based frameworks for learning human behavior. First, we study scenarios where closed-form economic models are available, and propose a behavior learning framework that integrates the economic models with deep learning. Second, we study scenarios where closed-form economic models are unavailable, and propose a framework that incorporates economic properties and constraints into behavior learning. Using penny auctions and continuous double auctions as case studies, we will demonstrate the experimental performance of our frameworks on real human behavior data.

                    近年来，安全博弈模型受到了大量关注，也被应用于不少实际场景中，如保护野生动物、防止城市犯罪等。但很少有研究考虑举报人在安全博弈中所起的作用。我们将举报人这一角色引入标准安全博弈模型，并系统性地研究了策略性举报人对安全博弈的影响。

                    我们将该问题建模为一个三方博弈，并认为举报人具有一个未知的类型，该类型将决定举报人的策略行为。在只有一个举报人的场景，我们定义了一个新的均衡概念，并借助机制设计相关理论，刻画了最优解的形式，证明最优策略中所使用的信息数量与目标数量相同，并由此简化了最优策略的计算问题。在具有多个举报人的场景，我们设计了一个基于简单多数投票的信息汇总策略，并证明该策略是最优的，且具有高效的算法。

                    Many areas such as algorithmic game theory, online algorithms, and operation research switched their focus from the worst-case analysis to stochastic optimization frameworks. This shift is well justified with the rapid growth and easy accessibility of data and the desire of many online companies to leverage statistical analysis. However, despite the unprecedented amounts of data, the dimensionality of data has also significantly increased. E.g., a prototypical example of Bayesian mechanism design for single-item auction with $n$ buyers may have $n$ in the range of hundreds in the online advertising context. In the stochastic optimization, it is typically assumed that the prior distributions are explicitly given by an exact probabilistic model, for the most part an independent multi-dimensional distribution. The later is a strong assumption that is extremely hard to verify statistically. In this talk, we discuss a new approach based on robust optimization. The idea is to relax strong mutual independence to a more statistically friendly pair-wise or more generally $k$-wise independence assumption. We then discuss how a few commonly used mechanisms such as sequential posted pricing and celebrated Myerson's mechanism, that maximizes revenue for the mutually independent prior, perform in this new framework.

                    We initiate the study of confusion matrix design. In this problem, an algorithm designer needs to generate a machine learning model (for a classification task from contexts to labels) which makes predictions for a population of downstream decision makers. The prediction accuracy of the machine learning model is characterized by its confusion matrix, which is a stochastic matrix where each entry encodes the probability of predicting the true label to another label. Each downstream decision maker faces a separate optimization task and will decide her binary action based on her own context, realized prediction given her context, and the confusion matrix selected by the algorithm designer. Decision makers are heterogeneous, as they may hold different contexts. Both the decision makers and the algorithm designer will obtain utilities that are determined by the actions the decision makers take, and their true labels. The goal of the algorithm designer is to design a single confusion matrix that is used for all decision makers subject to some feasibility constraints in order to maximize his net utility. We consider a general class of net utility functions, which could be a combination of both decision makers' utilities and the algorithm designer's utilities. Classic outcome-independent utility and utilitarian/Nash/egalitarian social welfare are all special cases of our net utility formulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We study the above problem through an information design framework, where we view training machine learning model as designing an information structure (signaling scheme) subject to some specific constraints motivated by the machine learning literature. By building the connection to the public persuasion with heterogeneous priors, we design convex programming-based algorithms that compute the optimal confusion matrix subject to (i) post-processing constraints and (ii) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) constraints in polynomial time, respectively. Besides the computational results, we also obtain analytical structural results and numerical results for the special cases of outcome-independent utility and social-aware utility, by utilizing the convex programming-based characterization of the optimal confusion matrix.

                    Clock auctions are a natural class of simple auction mechanisms. Clock auctions are known to enjoy strong properties, such as obvious strategyproofness, credibility, and privacy, which offer remarkable robustness in real-world scenarios. In contrast, computational aspects of clock auctions have not been explored as deeply. In this work, we investigate the computational problems of (1) checking whether a given way of allocating items to buyers (i.e., an allocation function) can be implemented by clock auctions, (2) finding a clock auction protocol (whenever there exists one) that implements a given allocation function, and (3) optimizing social welfare using clock auctions. We give polynomial-time algorithms for tasks (1) and (2), and show that task (3) is NP-hard. En route, we derive a complete characterization of the class of allocation functions that can be implemented by clock auctions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, we also investigate the economic efficiency of clock auctions. We connect welfare maximization (particularly in the special case with "independent groups") to the much cleaner problem of "upper tail extraction". We show that the (in)existence of constant-factor clock auction protocols for either problem implies that for the other problem. This can be viewed as a framework for designing approximately efficient clock auctions, or proving impossibility results thereof. To illustrate the power of this framework, we establish the existence of constant-factor clock auctions for upper tail extraction with iid agents, which implies the existence of constant-factor clock auctions for welfare maximization with independent groups that are each "homogeneous". We view this as strong evidence that constant-factor clock auctions exist for the general problem.

                    In cooperative games, we study how values created or costs incurred by a coalition are shared among the members within it, and the players may join the coalition in a online manner such as investors invest a startup. Recently, Ge et al. [10] proposed a new property called incentives for early arrival (I4EA) in such games, which says that the online allocation of values or costs should incentivize agents to join early in order to prevent mutual strategic waiting. Ideally, the allocation should also be fair, so that agents arriving in an order uniformly at random should expect to get/pay their Shapley values. Ge et al. [10] showed that not all monotone value functions admit such mechanisms in online value sharing games. In this work, we show a sharp contrast in online cost sharing games. We construct a mechanism with all the properties mentioned above, for every monotone cost function. To achieve this, we first solve 0-1 valued cost sharing games with a novel mechanism called Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanism (SFS-CS), and then extend SFS-CS to a family called generalized Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanisms (GSFS-CS). The critical technique we invented here is a mapping from one arrival order to another order so that we can directly apply marginal cost allocation on the shuffled orders to satisfy the properties. Finally, we solve general valued cost functions, by decomposing them into 0-1 valued functions in an online fashion.

                    In the field of online sequential decision-making, we address the problem with delays utilizing the framework of online convex optimization (OCO), where the feedback of a decision can arrive with an unknown delay. Unlike previous research that is limited to Euclidean norm and gradient information, we propose three families of delayed algorithms based on approximate solutions to handle different types of received feedback. Our proposed algorithms are versatile and applicable to universal norms. For each type of algorithm, we provide corresponding regret bounds under cases of general convexity and relative strong convexity, respectively. We also demonstrate the efficiency of each algorithm under different norms through concrete examples. Furthermore, our theoretical results are consistent with the current best bounds when degenerated to standard settings.

                    The predominant setting in classic auction theory considers bidders as \emph{utility maximizers (UMs)}, who aim to maximize quasi-linear utility functions. Recent autobidding strategies in online advertising have sparked interest in auction design with \emph{value maximizers (VMs)}, who aim to maximize the total value obtained. In this work, we investigate revenue-maximizing auction design for selling a single item to a mix of UMs and VMs. Crucially, we assume the UM/VM type is private information of a bidder. This shift to a multi-parameter domain complicates the design of incentive compatible mechanisms. Under this setting, we first characterize the optimal auction structure for auctions with a single bidder. We observe that the optimal auction moves gradually from a first-price auction to a Myerson auction as the probability of the bidder being a UM increases from 0 to 1. We also extend our study to multi-bidder setting and present an algorithm for deriving the optimal lookahead auction with multiple mixed types of bidders.

                    This paper studies a joint design problem where a seller can design both the signal structures for the agents to learn their values, and the allocation and payment rules for selling the item. In his seminal work, Myerson (1981) shows how to design the optimal auction with exogenous signals. We show that the problem becomes NP-hard when the seller also has the ability to design the signal structures. Our main result is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for computing the optimal joint design with at most an $\epsilon$ multiplicative loss in expected revenue. Moreover, we show that in our joint design problem, the seller can significantly reduce the information rent of the agents by providing partial information, which ensures a revenue that is at least $1−1/e$ of the optimal welfare for all valuation distributions.
